<h1>Variational AutoEncoder</h1>
<p>
    This is my first attempt at building a variational autoencoder (VAE). 
    I am using the MNIST dataset as a sample dataset to learn how to denoise images using a VAE.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to build an AE</li>
    <li>Learn how to build a VAE</li>
    <li>Use hyper-parameter optimization</li>
    <li>Make my VAE work universally on datasets</li>
    <li>Make my VAE able to act both as a tool using <em>main.py</em> and as a package by importing it in another python script</li>
</ul>
